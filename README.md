Here is a detailed README file for the project:

**Overview**
================================

Welcome to `nn`, a repository containing various deep learning models and scripts for experimenting with different neural network architectures. The repository is structured into folders, each representing a specific type of model (Transformer, GRU, LSTM, RNN). This README file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution guidelines.

**Installation**
================================

To use this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install the necessary packages, including Jupyter Notebook and NumPy.

**Usage**
================================

To run the models, navigate to the relevant folder (e.g., `LSTM`, `GRU`, etc.) and open the `.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook. Each notebook contains code cells that can be executed by running the cell or Shift+Enter.


**Contribution Guidelines**
================================

If you'd like to contribute to this project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository: Create a copy of the repository on your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch: In your forked repository, create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `feature/new-model`).
3. Make changes: Implement your desired changes in the relevant notebook or script.
4. Commit and push: Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
5. Open a pull request: Create a pull request from your forked repository to this original repository.
