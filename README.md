Here is a detailed README file for the project:

**Overview**
=====================================================================

This repository contains implementations of various neural network architectures, including Transformer, GRU, LSTM, and RNN models. The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive collection of deep learning algorithms in Python using popular libraries such as Jupyter Notebook.

**Installation**
=====================================================================

To use this project, you'll need to install the required dependencies. Here are the steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tapanBabbar9/nn.git`
2. Install the necessary packages:
	* Jupyter Notebook: `pip install jupyter`
	* TensorFlow (or other deep learning libraries): `pip install tensorflow` (or substitute with your preferred library)
3. Run Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`

**Usage**
=====================================================================

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the notebooks in the following folders:

1. **Transformer**: This folder contains implementations of Transformer models.
2. **GRU**, **LSTM**, and **RNN**: These folders contain implementations of GRU, LSTM, and RNN models respectively.
3. **Micrograd**: This folder contains micro-optimizations for backpropagation.

Each notebook in these folders is designed to demonstrate a specific neural network architecture. You can run each notebook individually by clicking on the "Run" button in Jupyter Notebook.

**Contribution Guidelines**
=====================================================================

We welcome contributions to this project! If you'd like to add a new neural network architecture or improve an existing one, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
2. Make your changes and commit them: `git add .` and `git commit -m "Added new feature"`
3. Push your changes: `git push origin <branch-name>`
4. Open a pull request: Go to the repository's main page, click on the "Pull requests" tab, and create a new pull request.
